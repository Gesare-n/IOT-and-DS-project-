## ✅ What We Accomplished

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated ESP32 with DHT11, soil moisture, and water level sensors.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays live sensor data for remote monitoring.
- **SMS Alerts**: Notifies users when moisture is low or other interventions are needed.
- **Offline Functionality**: SMS ensures functionality in areas with poor internet access.

## 💡 Why This Matters

- **Eliminates Guesswork**: Data-driven insights improve plant health.
- **Conserves Water**: Prevents over/under-watering, even without automation.
- **Empowers Users**: Lets farmers monitor their crops from anywhere.
- **Affordable & Scalable**: Built with cost-effective components (ESP32 + basic sensors).
