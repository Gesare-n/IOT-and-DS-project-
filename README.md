## ✅ What We Accomplished

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated ESP32 with DHT11, soil moisture, and water level sensors.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays live sensor data for remote monitoring.
- **SMS Alerts**: Notifies users when moisture is low or other interventions are needed.
- **Offline Functionality**: SMS ensures functionality in areas with poor internet access.
